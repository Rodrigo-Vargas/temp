   <p>As a full stack developer i'm worked mainly with Microsoft technologies, with focus in the Sharepoint plataform(2007, 2010, 2013). Because Sharepoint is a .NET based plataform, the backend is usually developed using C# as well, more precisally using .NET Web Forms. I also use a good variety front-end technologies, choosed based on the customer and projects requirements.</p>

   <p>At first, i worked as member of projects team, when i had the opportunity of learn a lot working with senior developers in projects with more than 600 hours of work. In that projects, i'm encountered some challenges like:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>Stricted delivery deadlines;</li>
      <li>Keep the code in the company code patterns;</li>
      <li>Analyze requeriments and estimate work effort;</li>
      <li>Searching for UX and performance improvements.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>In addition, I believe that i become a technical reference em some of then, due to proactivity, sense of leadership and because i enjoy help and change experiences with my teammates, developers or not.</p>

   <p>Currently, i'm working with the maintenance team, where we have many type of tasks:</p>
   
   <ul>
      <li>Requirements gathering;</li>
      <li>Prototypation and wireframing;</li>
      <li>Development of both front-end and back-end sides;</li>
      <li>Documentation;</li>
      <li>Work effort estimation;</li>
      <li>Suggestion of improvements on customer web portals, apps, and intranets.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>I have the opportunity of work with remote teams and with the home office modality occassionally, and to me, this is a very common communication type on my daily routine. In addition, I'm accountable with the supervisor of the unit interview new candidates of the development team.</p>

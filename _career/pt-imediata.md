   <p>
      Imediata is a small company with focus in development and maintenance of his ERP systems, builded using Cobol language. This
      company have customers of many areas, the mainly ones is grocery stores, rice mills, and contability offices.
   </p>

   <p>I was employed here as internal and i was prometed to the development job after one year. As development team internal,
      my task here was apply fixes in routines of all six products that company owns. Working here i had two great technical
      challenges: work with a legacy language, Cobol, that is very rare to find documentation, and the another challenge
      was migrate the systems to C#, two new languages to me in that time.
   </p>

   <p>As my first job inside a corporative environment, i learn most challenges that come with the daily job, experience
      that is not possible acquire in college, some of then is:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Read and understand long source codes, with many business rules;</li>
      <li>Colaborative development;</li>
      <li>Contact with customers;</li>
      <li>Objectives and deadline, and most part of the challenges that every corporate environment.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>During the 18 months that i worked here, i made all the possible type of tasks in the software development cycle, like
      talk about the function requeriments with the customers, develop the software and deploy the code. Also i'm proud
      of developing the first sales comission sustem of the company, integrating with the invoice system, accounting manager
      system, and another ones. A task that require great effort and constant interaction with the customers, and that
      module is used until now in that company.</p>

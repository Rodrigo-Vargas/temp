                  <h4>Conectt / </h4>
                  <h5>2013 - Now</h5>
                  <p> Conectt is a company with expertise in development of websites, intranets, and digital marketing analyze for big companies.
                     There i had the opportunity to work with great companies as customers, like Dupont Pioneer, Universal Leaf Tobbacos,
                     Grupo Boticário, Promonlogicalis and Demarest Advogados. </p>
                  <p> Here, we worked mainly with Microsoft technologies, with focus in the Sharepoint plataform(2007, 2010, 2013). Because
                     Sharepoint is a .NET based plataform, the backend is developed using C# as well, more precisally using .NET Web
                     Forms. We also use many front-end technologies, choosed according the customer and projects requirements. </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Angular JS</li>
                     <li>jQuery</li>
                     <li>CSS</li>
                     <li>HTML</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In the beginning, i worked as member of projectis team, i learn a lot working with a team in projects with more than
                     600 hours of work. In that projects, i'm encountered new challenges like:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Stricted delivery deadlines;</li>
                     <li>Follow and suggest new code pattern;</li>
                     <li>Requirement analyze and and work effort estimation;</li>
                     <li>Detection of improvements.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In addition, I believe that i become a technical reference em some of then, due to proactivity, sense of leadership
                     and because i enjoy interacte and change experiences with another colleagues, developers or not.</p>
                  <p>Lately, i'm working with the maintenance contract team, where we have many type of tasks, beginning in requirements
                     analyze, prototypation, development of front-end and back-end, also, we made documentation, work effort estimation
                     and improvements suggestion of products of the customers.</p>
                  <p>I have the opportunity of work with remote teams and with the home office modality occassionally, and to me, this is
                     a very common communication type on my daily routine. In addition, I'm accountable with the supervisor of the unit
                     to interview new candidates of the development team.

                  </p>
            
                  <p>I was employed here as internal and i was prometed to the development job after one year. As development team internal,
                     my task here was apply fixes in routines of all six products that company owns. Working here i had two great technical
                     challenges: work with a legacy language, Cobol, that is very rare to find documentation, and the another challenge
                     was migrate the systems to C#, two new languages to me in that time.
                  </p>
            
                  <p>As my first job inside a corporative environment, i learn most challenges that come with the daily job, experience
                     that is not possible acquire in college, some of then is:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Read and understand long source codes, with many business rules;</li>
                     <li>Colaborative development;</li>
                     <li>Contact with customers;</li>
                     <li>Objectives and deadline, and most part of the challenges that every corporate environment.</li>
                  </ul>
            
                  <p>During the 18 months that i worked here, i made all the possible type of tasks in the software development cycle, like
                     talk about the function requeriments with the customers, develop the software and deploy the code. Also i'm proud
                     of developing the first sales comission sustem of the company, integrating with the invoice system, accounting manager
                     system, and another ones. A task that require great effort and constant interaction with the customers, and that
                     module is used until now in that company.</p>

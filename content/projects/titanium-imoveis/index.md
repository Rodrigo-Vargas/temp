  title: Titanium Imoveis
---

Project developed as a contractor for Titanium Imoveis, a real estate agency based in Novo Hamburgo/RS.

This client came to me with issues about usability, reliability and performance of the administrative part of his website. Using an architecture with React with Redux, I proposed a new layout that addressed more than 80 fields of application, making the user experience more pleasant and productive.

Also, this is allow us, to keep going the completely migration on the old .NET Framework 3.5 plataform that it was originally written to a more modern and flexible solution.

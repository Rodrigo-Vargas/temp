The main object of this project was to be a place where I can showcase some of my projects and to build a online presence. I already built it using many technologies, because beside the main objective, I always using it as a playground of the technology I want to learn. The very first version was built on top of Wordpress, after some time, I build a custom plataform using Ruby On Rails. After that, I migrated to a static site generator called Jekyll, unitl finally in the nowadays, migrated to gatsby.js plataform.

I also learn a lot of design and UX prototyping many versions of it.

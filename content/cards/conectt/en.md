  Here, we worked mainly with Microsoft technologies, with focus in the Sharepoint plataform(2007, 2010, 2013). Because Sharepoint is a .NET based plataform, the backend is developed using C# as well, more precisally using .NET Web Forms. We also use many front-end technologies, choosed according the customer and projects requirements.

  <li>Stricted delivery deadlines;</li>
  <li>Follow and suggest new code pattern;</li>
  <li>Requirement analyze and and work effort estimation;</li>

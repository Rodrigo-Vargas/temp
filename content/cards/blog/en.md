<p>Since 2015, I manage and build my own personal blog. I have tried a few plataforms to build it, with the objective of found the plataform that I feel more confortable to use. In the very beggining I used Wordpress, migrating to Jekyll, a static site generator few months later. By the last, I rebuild the blog using Ruby on Rails, and that is the technology that will power this blog from now on.</p>

<p>I use this blog to make some experiments with various techonologies as well to keep contact with the developers community. With its building, I could improve my skills with manage of devops, deploy techniques and developing in multiple plataforms.</p>
